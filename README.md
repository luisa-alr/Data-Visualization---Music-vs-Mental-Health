The Rhythm of Mental Wellness: Exploring the Relationship Between Music Preferences and Mental Health

Abstract:
This project will examine the relationship between music preferences and mental health, utilizing data from the "MxMH Survey Results" dataset. Music Therapy (MT) leverages music to improve stress, mood, and overall mental well-being by stimulating "happy" hormones like oxytocin. Although MT includes diverse genres tailored to individual needs, questions remain about the specific impact of genre preferences on mental health. Collected through a public survey, the dataset captures demographics, music habits, genre preferences, and mental health ratings, providing a foundation for exploring music’s role in mental health. By analyzing trends in how music genres influence mental health indicators, the project aims to uncover patterns that reveal music's potential as a therapeutic tool. Through analyzing this dataset, we hope to explore how MT can be applied and gain deeper insights into how music affects people’s mental health. This could lead to a better understanding of the psychological impact of music and pave the way for innovative, drug-free treatments, offering individuals with ADHD or depression alternative therapies that harness the power of sound.
